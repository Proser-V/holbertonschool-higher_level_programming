    This module include a program that solves the N queens problem.
    The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking
    queens on an NÃ—N chessboard

Usage:

    Check whether a queen can be safely placed at the given row and column.

    A queen can be placed if there is no other queen in the same column
    or on the same diagonal (positive or negative slope) in any previous row.

    Args:
        row (int): The row index where the queen is to be placed.
        column (int): The column index where the queen is to be placed.
        queen_pos (list): A list of column indices representing the positions
                          of queens already placed in previous rows. The index
                          of the list represents the row, and the value at that
                          index represents the column.
